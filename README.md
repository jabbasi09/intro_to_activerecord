Lecture code on active record - January-12th

Active Record is an ORM - it does the same sort of 
tasks we learned about previously with ORMs. Using Active Record, 
just like using an ORM, can make fetching and representing data easier. 
Using Active Record saves us the trouble of writing our own custom ORMs.
